# Bellybutton Biodiversity

## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset. I used Flask to design an API for the dataset and to serve the HTML and JavaScript required for the dashboard page. Plotly.js was used to build interactive charts for the dashboard.
